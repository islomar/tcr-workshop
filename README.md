# TCR workshop
Information and instructions for trying the TCR workflow (test && commit || revert) as first described [here](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864).

This repository contains scripts for a Python, Java and a NetCore example, each of them in their own folders.

[Here](https://speakerdeck.com/islomar/tcr-workshop) you can find the slides used for a worshop facilitated with [Joe Bew](https://twitter.com/joebew42) in Stockholm.

There is also a generic folder with scripts that could be easily adapted to your specific language (`/tcr-generic`).


## Prerequisites
* You need Git installed.
* A basic test running (see "How to set up a basic test" section if you're having problems).


## How to set up a basic test
[Here](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps) you can find lots of templates for different languages. Plus, you have `tcr-python`, `tcr-java` and `tcr-csharp` folders ready in this repo.


## IDE configuration
* **VERY IMPORTANT**: Disable the "Auto-save".
    - IntelliJ: http://thehunk.blogspot.com/2015/07/disable-auto-save-in-jetbrains-ide.html
* Be sure the file is being **automatically refreshed** (to see the file reverted when the tests fail).
    - VS Studio Code. Several options: 
        - enable "experimental file watcher" from File -> Settings. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work "too well".
        - Reload Window: Ctl + 5
        - Or configure a shortcut for "File revert" (e.g. "Alt + Shift + r")


## How to configure your environment for TCR
There are several options for configuring your local environment so that you code gets automatically committed or reverted:
* Option 1: IDE
    - Use a plugin on your favourite IDE. 
        - For example, in IntelliJ you have "Limited WIP": https://github.com/dkandalov/limited-wip (though, to be honest, it didn't work too well for me...).
        - In VS Studio you could play with "Watched Path Autoexec": https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hexix.watched-path-autoexec
* Option 2: scripts
    - A more agnostic solution: use the scripts included under the folder `/scripts` of each java/python/generic folder of this repo (or create your own). The scripts are based on [these](https://medium.com/@tdeniffel/real-world-tcr-bb9958234bf8).
    - You can either:
        - install `inotifywait` or something similar depending on your OS:
            - E.g. in Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install inotify-tools`
            - On Mac OS X: `brew install fswatch`
            - On Windows, one option is to use Cygwin and run the Linux scripts.
            - If you use something different to `inotifywait`, modify your `watch.sh` file.
        - install the `watch` utility (it exists in both Linux and Mac OSX), and use the `watch-generic.sh` script included under the folder `tcr-generic`
    - To run the scripts, go to your specific folder (e.g. `tcr-python`), and run `./watch.sh` or `watch-generic.sh` (if using the generic one with `watch`)


## Proposed exercise
* You can try the TCR workflow with the Fibonacci kata, included [here](Fibonacci-kata.md)
* Another simple exercise to practice it is the [substring kata](Substring-kata.md)


## Bonus track
* There is a variant where, when failing the tests, before reverting, you stash and print your changes. That would allow you to check what was the difference between last time it was green and now. Here you have the proposal and the scripts: https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2018/11/13/test-driven-programming-workflows.html
* Another more relaxed variant here: https://medium.com/@tdeniffel/tcr-variants-test-commit-revert-bf6bd84b17d3

### How to squash
* Since the TCR scripts will be automatically commiting, you should first squash you commits before pushing to the remote branch.
* Here a reminder about how to do it: https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git
